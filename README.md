# ComboBoxComponent
![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/marcellosurdi/ComboBoxComponent)

## Description
ComboBoxComponent is a very lightweight (just over 7KB) and dependency-free web component written in pure JavaScript.

## Motivation
The same motivation as always: I needed a component that didn't require any heavy dependencies. I didn't find anything that met all my needs, so I developed mine.

## Compatibility
All desktop/mobile recent browsers.

## Build
To compile ComboBoxComponent by yourself, make sure that you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then:
1. Fork and clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcellosurdi/ComboBoxComponent).
2. From the command line go to the local ComboBoxComponent folder.
3. Run `npm install` and wait for the necessary modules installation. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/#root) will be installed, look at the other dev dependencies in the `package.json` file.
4. The `npm run dev` command opens a new browser window for developing purposes, `npm run build` compiles in `dist` folder.

That's it!
