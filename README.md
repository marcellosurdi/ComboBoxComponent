1. Fork and clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcellosurdi/Webpack5Template).
2. From the command line go to the local Webpack5Template folder.
3. Run `npm install` and wait for the necessary modules installation. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/#root) will be installed, look at the other dev dependencies in `package.json` file.
